# Document Archive

This directory serves as an archive for documents that have been processed and integrated into the context network.

## Purpose

The archive directory stores original documents that have been processed from the inbox folder. After a document has been analyzed and its information has been integrated into the appropriate locations within the context network, the original document is moved here for reference and preservation.

## Archive Structure

Documents in the archive are organized by date of processing:

```
archive/
├── YYYY-MM-DD/
│   ├── [original-document-1]
│   ├── [original-document-2]
│   └── ...
├── YYYY-MM-DD/
│   ├── [original-document-1]
│   ├── [original-document-2]
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## Archiving Process

When archiving a document:

1. Create a directory for the current date if it doesn't exist (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
2. Move the original document from the inbox to the appropriate date directory
3. Update the `meta/updates.md` file to record the document processing
4. Ensure all information from the document has been properly integrated into the context network

## Accessing Archived Documents

Archived documents can be accessed for reference purposes, but should not be modified. If information needs to be updated, the changes should be made to the appropriate files within the context network structure.

## Retention Policy

[Define the retention policy for archived documents, including how long they should be kept and any procedures for eventual purging or long-term storage]

## Relationship to Document Integration Process

This archive is part of the document integration process described in `processes/document_integration.md`. Refer to that document for the complete process of handling documents from the inbox through to archiving.
