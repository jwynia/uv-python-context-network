### What is UV?

UV is a modern, high-performance Python package manager and installer written in Rust. It serves as a drop-in replacement for traditional Python tools like pip, pip-tools, and virtualenv, offering significant performance improvements and enhanced features.

Key characteristics of UV include:

1. **Performance**: UV is significantly faster than traditional Python tools due to its Rust implementation
2. **Compatibility**: UV aims to be a drop-in replacement for existing Python tooling
3. **Modern Features**: UV incorporates modern packaging best practices and standards
4. **Deterministic Resolution**: UV provides deterministic dependency resolution for reproducible environments

### Why UV-Only?

This project template enforces a UV-only approach to Python development for several reasons:

1. **Consistency**: Eliminating the option to fall back to traditional Python tools ensures consistent workflows and prevents confusion
2. **Performance**: Leveraging UV's performance advantages across all package operations improves developer experience
3. **Best Practices**: Encouraging the use of modern Python packaging standards and practices
4. **Clarity for AI Agents**: Providing clear constraints for AI agents working with the project, preventing them from attempting to use traditional Python tooling

### UV vs. Traditional Python Tools

| Feature | UV | Traditional Tools | Advantage |
|---------|----|--------------------|-----------|
| Package Installation | `uv pip install` | `pip install` | UV is significantly faster |
| Virtual Environments | `uv venv` | `python -m venv` | UV creates environments faster |
| Dependency Resolution | Deterministic with lockfile | Can vary between installations | UV provides more reproducible builds |
| Python Version Management | `uv python install` | Requires separate tools (pyenv) | UV integrates Python version management |
| Configuration | pyproject.toml-centric | Various files (requirements.txt, setup.py) | UV uses modern standards |

### Core UV Commands

| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `uv venv` | Create a virtual environment | `uv venv` |
| `uv pip install` | Install packages | `uv pip install requests` |
| `uv pip compile` | Generate lockfiles | `uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.lock` |
| `uv pip sync` | Synchronize environment with lockfile | `uv pip sync requirements.lock` |
| `uv python install` | Install Python versions | `uv python install 3.12` |
| `uv run` | Run Python scripts | `uv run script.py` |

### Integration with Modern Python Practices

UV integrates well with modern Python development practices:

1. **PEP 621 Support**: UV works with the modern pyproject.toml standard
2. **Lockfile Approach**: UV supports deterministic builds through lockfiles
3. **Containerized Development**: UV works well in containerized environments
4. **CI/CD Integration**: UV can be used in continuous integration workflows

### Current Limitations

As a relatively new tool, UV has some limitations to be aware of:

1. **Evolving API**: The command interface may change as the tool matures
2. **Community Adoption**: Some documentation and community resources may still reference traditional tools
3. **Tool Integration**: Some development tools may not yet have direct UV integration
