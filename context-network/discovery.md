# Context Network Navigation Guide

## Overview

This context network contains all planning documents, conceptual work, and coordination information for the project. It is organized into several key sections to facilitate navigation and information discovery.

## Structure

The context network is organized as follows:

```
context-network/
├── discovery.md                # This navigation guide
├── foundation/                 # Core project information
│   ├── project_definition.md   # Main project purpose and goals
│   ├── structure.md            # Project structure overview
│   └── principles.md           # Guiding principles and standards
├── elements/                   # Domain-specific information
│   └── [element-specific folders and files]

│   ├── dependencies.md         # Dependencies between elements
│   └── interfaces.md           # Interface definitions
├── meta/                       # Information about the network itself
│   ├── updates.md              # Record of network changes

└── archive/                    # Archived documents from the inbox

## Navigation Paths

### For New Project Members
1. Start with `foundation/project_definition.md` to understand the project's purpose
2. Review `foundation/principles.md` to understand guiding principles
3. Explore `foundation/structure.md` for a project overview
4. Check `planning/roadmap.md` to understand current priorities

### For Creating New Elements
1. Review relevant element documentation in `elements/`
2. Check `connections/dependencies.md` for integration points
3. Review applicable decision records in `decisions/`
4. Follow the process in `processes/creation.md`

### For Understanding Key Decisions
1. Start with `decisions/decision_index.md`
2. Navigate to specific decision records of interest
3. Review related structure documentation in `foundation/structure.md`

### For Document Integration
1. Follow the process outlined in `processes/document_integration.md`
2. Update relevant sections of the context network
3. Record changes in `meta/updates.md`
4. Archive processed documents in `archive/`

## Maintenance

This context network is maintained according to the procedures documented in `meta/maintenance.md`. All changes to the network structure should be recorded in `meta/updates.md`.

## Classification System

Information nodes in this context network are classified along these dimensions:

1. **Domain**: [Primary knowledge area]
   - Examples: Core Concept, Supporting Element, External Factor, Resource, Output
   - Project-specific examples might include: Research, Design, Content, Process, Outcome

2. **Stability**: [Change frequency expectation]
   - Static: Fundamental principles unlikely to change
   - Semi-stable: Established patterns that evolve gradually
   - Dynamic: Frequently changing information

3. **Abstraction**: [Detail level]
   - Conceptual: High-level ideas and principles
   - Structural: Organizational patterns and frameworks
   - Detailed: Specific implementations and examples

4. **Confidence**: [Information reliability]
   - Established: Verified and reliable information
   - Evolving: Partially validated but subject to refinement
   - Speculative: Exploratory ideas requiring validation
