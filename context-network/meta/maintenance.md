# Context Network Maintenance

## Purpose
This document outlines the procedures for maintaining and evolving the context network to ensure it remains valuable, accurate, and navigable over time.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Documentation
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Content

### Maintenance Schedule

The context network should be maintained according to the following schedule:

1. **Daily Maintenance**
   - Process any new documents in the inbox folder
   - Update active information nodes with new developments

2. **Weekly Maintenance**
   - Review recent changes for consistency and completeness
   - Ensure all relationships are bidirectional and accurate
   - Check for orphaned nodes or broken navigation paths

3. **Monthly Maintenance**
   - Evaluate the overall structure for effectiveness
   - Identify areas that need expansion or consolidation
   - Update navigation guides to reflect current best paths

4. **Quarterly Review**
   - Perform a comprehensive review of the entire network
   - Assess alignment with project goals and needs
   - Plan structural improvements or reorganization as needed

### Maintenance Procedures

#### Document Processing

1. Follow the process in `processes/document_integration.md` for all new documents
2. Ensure all processed documents are properly archived
3. Update `meta/updates.md` with all changes

#### Relationship Maintenance

1. Regularly check that all referenced relationships exist in both directions
2. Verify that relationship types are appropriate and consistent
3. Update relationship descriptions as understanding evolves
4. Remove obsolete relationships and add missing ones

#### Navigation Improvement

1. Review common navigation paths for efficiency
2. Update navigation guidance based on observed usage patterns
3. Ensure all nodes have appropriate "Next Steps" guidance
4. Maintain clear paths for different user personas and tasks

#### Structure Evolution

1. Monitor the growth of different sections of the network
2. Split overly large nodes into more focused components
3. Consolidate fragmented information when appropriate
4. Create new sections or categories as needed

### Special Cases

#### Conflicting Information

When conflicting information is identified:

1. Document the conflict explicitly in both nodes
2. Use the "contradicts" relationship type to connect them
3. Provide context about when each perspective applies
4. If possible, create a reconciliation node that explains the differences

#### Deprecated Information

When information becomes outdated:

1. Mark the node as deprecated with a clear notice
2. Add a reference to the replacement information
3. Maintain the node in place for historical context
4. Update all references to point to the current information

#### External References

For information that lives outside the context network:

1. Create a reference node within the appropriate section
2. Clearly document the external location and access method
3. Include a summary of the key points from the external source
4. Establish a verification schedule to ensure the reference remains valid

### Network Health Metrics

Monitor these indicators of context network health:

1. **Coverage**: Percentage of project aspects documented in the network
2. **Freshness**: Average time since last update of information nodes
3. **Connectivity**: Average number of relationships per node
4. **Navigability**: Number of steps required to reach key information
5. **Consistency**: Degree of terminology and structure standardization
6. **Usage**: Frequency and patterns of network access and reference
