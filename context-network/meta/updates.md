### Update Log

#### 2025-05-19: GitHub Template Preparation
- **Documents Processed:**
  - None (template preparation)
- **Changes Made:**
  - Added .gitignore file with Python and UV-specific patterns
  - Updated pyproject.toml with template-specific metadata and optional dependencies
  - Created example package structure in src/package_name
  - Added tests directory with example test
  - Added LICENSE file (MIT)
  - Added GitHub templates and workflows (.github directory)
  - Enhanced README.md with badges, project structure, and customization instructions
- **Affected Nodes:**
  - None (changes were to project artifacts, not context network)
- **Rationale:**
  - Prepared the template for publishing to GitHub
  - Added standard files expected in a Python project
  - Provided example code to demonstrate UV usage
  - Added GitHub-specific files for better collaboration
- **Follow-up Actions:**
  - Consider updating the context network documentation to reference the new example code
  - Consider adding more detailed customization instructions in the context network

#### 2025-05-19: UV Python Technical Constraints and Structure Enhancement
- **Documents Processed:**
  - None (internal enhancement)
- **Changes Made:**
  - Created new document detailing UV Python technical constraints (constraints.md)
  - Enhanced structure.md with more detailed information about file structure and UV interactions
  - Added information about required vs. recommended files
  - Added details about UV's interaction with the file structure
  - Added migration considerations for existing Python projects
- **Affected Nodes:**
  - context-network/elements/uv-python/constraints.md (new)
  - context-network/elements/uv-python/structure.md
  - context-network/meta/updates.md
- **Rationale:**
  - Provided more specific documentation about technical constraints imposed by the UV-exclusive approach
  - Enhanced existing structure documentation with more detailed information
  - Added guidance for migrating existing Python projects to the UV approach
  - Documented common pitfalls and integration limitations
- **Follow-up Actions:**
  - Consider updating workflow.md to include more specific guidance on working within these constraints
  - Create example migration guides for common Python project types
  - Consider adding a troubleshooting guide for common UV-related issues

#### 2025-05-19: UV Python Project Template Configuration
- **Documents Processed:**
  - inbox/uv-python-devcontainer.md
- **Changes Made:**
  - Updated foundation documents (project_definition.md, structure.md, principles.md) to reflect UV Python focus
  - Created UV Python element with detailed documentation (overview.md, structure.md, devcontainer.md, workflow.md, commands.md)
  - Added decision record for UV-exclusive approach (uv_exclusive_approach.md)
  - Updated decision index to include the new decision
- **Affected Nodes:**
  - context-network/foundation/project_definition.md
  - context-network/foundation/structure.md
  - context-network/foundation/principles.md
  - context-network/elements/uv-python/overview.md
  - context-network/elements/uv-python/structure.md
  - context-network/elements/uv-python/devcontainer.md
  - context-network/elements/uv-python/workflow.md
  - context-network/elements/uv-python/commands.md
  - context-network/decisions/uv_exclusive_approach.md
  - context-network/decisions/decision_index.md
- **Rationale:**
  - Specialized the generic context network template for a specific use case: Python development with UV
  - Documented the technical aspects and constraints of the UV Python project template
  - Captured the decision to use UV exclusively, with no fallback to traditional Python tools
- **Follow-up Actions:**
  - Consider creating additional decision records for specific UV configuration choices
  - Update README.md to reflect the UV Python focus
  - Consider creating example workflows for common UV Python development tasks
