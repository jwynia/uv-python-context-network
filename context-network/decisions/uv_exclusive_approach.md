### Decision

**We will use UV exclusively for all Python package and environment management, deliberately blocking access to traditional Python tools (pip, virtualenv, etc.) in the development environment.**

### Context

UV is a modern, high-performance Python package manager and installer written in Rust that serves as a drop-in replacement for traditional Python tools like pip, pip-tools, and virtualenv. As a relatively new tool in the Python ecosystem, there's a risk that developers and AI agents might fall back to using traditional Python tools out of habit or familiarity, leading to inconsistency and confusion.

### Problem Statement

When working with Python projects, developers and AI agents often have multiple ways to accomplish the same task (e.g., installing packages with pip or UV). This can lead to:

1. Inconsistent workflows across team members
2. Confusion when following documentation that references different tools
3. Mixed approaches within the same project
4. AI agents attempting to use familiar but non-optimal tools

### Options Considered

#### Option 1: Mixed Approach
Allow both UV and traditional Python tools to coexist in the development environment.

**Pros:**
- Easier transition for developers familiar with traditional tools
- More flexibility in workflows
- Compatible with existing documentation and tutorials

**Cons:**
- Inconsistent workflows
- Potential for confusion
- May not fully leverage UV's advantages
- AI agents might default to traditional tools

#### Option 2: UV-Preferred Approach
Make UV the primary tool but allow traditional tools as fallbacks.

**Pros:**
- Encourages UV usage while providing safety nets
- Smoother transition for teams
- Still compatible with existing workflows

**Cons:**
- Inconsistency still possible
- Unclear boundaries between when to use which tool
- May lead to mixed dependency management

#### Option 3: UV-Exclusive Approach
Use UV exclusively and deliberately block access to traditional Python tools.

**Pros:**
- Consistent workflows across the project
- Forces learning and adoption of modern tools
- Clear constraints for AI agents
- Fully leverages UV's performance advantages
- Prevents mixed dependency management

**Cons:**
- Steeper learning curve for developers unfamiliar with UV
- May require custom documentation
- Potential compatibility issues with some existing tools

### Decision Criteria

The decision was evaluated against these criteria:

1. **Consistency**: How well does the option ensure consistent workflows?
2. **Performance**: How well does the option leverage UV's performance advantages?
3. **Learning Curve**: How steep is the learning curve for new developers?
4. **AI Agent Clarity**: How clear are the constraints for AI agents?
5. **Maintainability**: How maintainable is the approach over time?

### Decision Outcome

We selected **Option 3: UV-Exclusive Approach** for the following reasons:

1. **Consistency**: The UV-exclusive approach ensures maximum consistency by eliminating alternatives.
2. **Performance**: It fully leverages UV's performance advantages across all package operations.
3. **Learning Curve**: While the learning curve may be steeper initially, UV's commands are similar enough to traditional tools that the transition should be manageable.
4. **AI Agent Clarity**: It provides clear constraints for AI agents, preventing them from attempting to use traditional Python tools.
5. **Maintainability**: A single toolchain is easier to maintain and document than multiple overlapping ones.

### Implementation

The UV-exclusive approach is implemented through:

1. **Custom DevContainer**: A development container that installs UV but deliberately blocks access to traditional Python tools
2. **Command Interception**: Shell wrapper scripts that intercept attempts to use pip or python directly
3. **Clear Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of UV commands and workflows
4. **pyproject.toml**: Configuration focused on modern Python packaging standards

### Consequences

#### Positive

- Consistent workflows across the project
- Better performance for package operations
- Clear constraints for AI agents
- Alignment with modern Python packaging standards
- Simplified dependency management

#### Negative

- Potential learning curve for developers unfamiliar with UV
- May require custom documentation for common tasks
- Possible friction when following external tutorials that use traditional tools

#### Neutral

- Developers will need to translate traditional Python commands to their UV equivalents
- Some external tools may need to be run through UV rather than directly

### Compliance Verification

To verify compliance with this decision:

1. Check that the DevContainer configuration blocks access to traditional Python tools
2. Ensure all documentation uses UV commands exclusively
3. Verify that all CI/CD pipelines use UV commands
4. Test with AI agents to ensure they don't attempt to use traditional tools
