## Navigation Guidance
- **Access Context:** Use this document when making significant decisions or evaluating options
- **Common Next Steps:** After reviewing principles, typically explore structure.md or specific decision records
- **Related Tasks:** Decision-making, design reviews, code reviews, process definition
- **Update Patterns:** This document should be updated rarely, only when fundamental principles change
