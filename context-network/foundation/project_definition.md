## Content

### Project Overview

The UV Python Project Template is a base repository template for working with Python code specifically via the modern UV package manager setup. It provides a standardized starting point for Python development that enforces the use of UV (a high-performance Python package manager written in Rust) instead of traditional Python tooling.

### Vision Statement

To provide a streamlined, efficient, and modern Python development environment that leverages UV's performance advantages while eliminating confusion and inconsistency from mixed tooling approaches.

### Mission Statement

This template enables developers and AI agents to create Python projects with consistent dependency management, improved performance, and simplified workflows by providing a pre-configured environment that exclusively uses UV for all Python-related operations.

### Project Objectives

1. Provide a standardized starting point for Python development using UV
2. Enforce the exclusive use of UV for Python package management and environment handling
3. Eliminate confusion and inconsistency from mixed Python tooling approaches
4. Demonstrate best practices for modern Python development with UV

### Success Criteria

1. All Python dependencies are managed exclusively through UV
2. Development environment prevents fallback to traditional Python tools (pip, virtualenv)
3. Project structure follows modern Python packaging standards
4. Documentation clearly explains UV-specific workflows and commands

### Project Scope

#### In Scope

- Base repository structure for Python projects using UV
- DevContainer configuration that enforces UV-only usage
- Context network documentation for UV Python development
- Basic project configuration (pyproject.toml)

#### Out of Scope

- Specific application logic or business domain implementation
- Detailed software methodologies (left to the user of this template)
- Integration with specific CI/CD platforms
- Extensive Python package dependencies

### Stakeholders

| Role | Responsibilities | Representative(s) |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Template Maintainers | Keeping the template updated with latest UV features | Project team |
| Python Developers | Using the template for Python projects | End users |
| AI Agents | Working within the template constraints | Claude, GPT, etc. |

### Constraints

- Must work with modern Python versions (3.12+)
- Must enforce UV-only package management
- Must provide clear documentation on UV workflows
- Must maintain compatibility with standard Python project structures

### Assumptions

- Users have basic familiarity with Python development
- Development will primarily occur in containerized environments
- UV will continue to be maintained and improved as a Python package manager

### Risks

- UV is relatively new compared to traditional Python tools and may evolve rapidly
- Some Python packages or workflows might not be fully compatible with UV
- Developers unfamiliar with UV may face a learning curve
- AI agents might attempt to use traditional Python tooling if not properly constrained

## Navigation Guidance
- **Access Context:** Use this document when needing to understand the fundamental purpose and scope of the UV Python template
- **Common Next Steps:** After reviewing this definition, explore structure.md or the UV Python element documentation
- **Related Tasks:** Python project setup, dependency management planning, development environment configuration
- **Update Patterns:** This document should be updated when there are fundamental changes to UV capabilities or project direction
