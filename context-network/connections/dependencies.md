# Element Dependencies

## Purpose
This document maps the dependencies between different elements of the project, helping to understand how changes in one element might impact others.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Structure
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established
